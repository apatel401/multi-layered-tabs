                    <p>In 1914, Canada was part of the British Empire. As the 20th century progressed, Canada had to
                        face many difficult tests: two world wars, the Great Depression, the Cold War, and numerous
                        political, social, and economic crises. On the
                        world stage, Canada earned a reputation as a strong independent nation.</p>
                    <p>At home, Canada was working on defining its goals and refining its identity.</p>
                    <p>As you study Canada’s past, you’ll start to examine how it became the country you live in today a
                        country whose values are described in former Prime Minister Diefenbaker’s
                        Canadian Bill of Rights.</p>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>In this course, you’ll explore the social, economic, and political developments and events that
                        took place in Canada since 1914, and you’ll understand how they impacted the lives of different
                        groups in Canada. You’ll examine the role of
                        conflict and cooperation in Canadian society, at Canada’s evolving role within the global
                        community, and you’ll learn about the impact of various individuals, organizations, and events
                        on Canadian identity, citizenship, and heritage.
                    </p>
                    <p>The time span from 1914 to present day has been divided into four periods: 1914–1929; 1929–1945;
                        1945–1982; and 1982 to the present. Each period will be studied in turn using the historical
                        inquiry process and historical thinking
                        concepts.</p>
